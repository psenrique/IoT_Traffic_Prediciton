# IoT_Traffic_Prediciton
Understanding the traffic patterns in a major city allows for the department of transportation (DoT) to schedule maintenance and future developments. Analyzing the data gathered allows for transportation optimization and efficiency and to aid in the development of a smart city. This analysis aims to predict the traffic flow using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the linear regression models. Both models are compared to determine which is a better predictor of the traffic volume. Additionally, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model are compared to predict the weather with a one-hour predictive horizon. For this analysis the dataset selected is publicly available through the US Irvine Machine Learning Repository and contains environmental and traffic information from I-94 westbound in Minneapolis-St Paul, MN. The data is collected by the MN DoT Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) station 301 located midway between Minneapolis and St Paul, MN using a collection of sensors. The sensor measurements are recorded hourly from 2012-2018 for a total of 48204 observations.
